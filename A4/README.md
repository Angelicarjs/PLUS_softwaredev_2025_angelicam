# Strava Activity Analysis

This repository contains a set of Python functions developed as part of **Assignment A3**.

The main goal is to explore and visualize Strava activity data in a spatial and statistical context using Python geospatial tools.

## Features

The script includes functions to:

- Load and clean raw Strava data from CSV exports.
- Extract and parse latitude and longitude from string-encoded fields.
- Plot distributions of average and maximum speed using Seaborn.
- Visualize activity start and end points on an interactive map with Folium.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- pandas
- geopandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- folium
- shapely

or use the environment (yml)
